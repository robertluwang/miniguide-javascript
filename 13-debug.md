## 13. Debugging Tools

- **Browser Console:**
Most modern browsers provide a built-in developer console that allows you to log messages, inspect variables, and execute code directly within your webpage.

```javascript
console.log("Debugging message");
```

- **Debugging Techniques:**
- **Logging:** Use `console.log()` to print variable values and debug messages.
- **Breakpoints:** Set breakpoints in your code to pause execution and inspect variables.
- **Step Through:** Use step-by-step debugging to follow code execution line by line.
- **Inspect Variables:** Use the console or debugging tools to inspect variable values.
- **Error Messages:** Pay attention to error messages to identify and fix issues.

- **Common Debugging Errors:**
- **Syntax Errors:** Incorrect syntax that prevents code from running.
- **Logical Errors:** Code runs, but produces incorrect results.
- **Runtime Errors:** Errors that occur during code execution.

- **Debugging Workflow:**
1. **Identify the Problem:** Understand what's causing the issue.
2. **Reproduce the Issue:** Make sure the problem is consistent.
3. **Inspect the Code:** Check for syntax errors, typos, and logical issues.
4. **Use Debugging Tools:** Utilize breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables.
5. **Fix the Issue:** Apply necessary changes to resolve the problem.
6. **Test and Verify:** Confirm that the issue is resolved and the code behaves as expected.
