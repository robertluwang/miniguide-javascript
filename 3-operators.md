## 3. Operators

- **Arithmetic Operators:**
Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical calculations on numeric values.

```javascript
var x = 10;
var y = 5;

var sum = x + y;     // Addition
var difference = x - y; // Subtraction
var product = x * y; // Multiplication
var quotient = x / y; // Division
var remainder = x % y; // Modulus (remainder of division)
```

- **Assignment Operators:**
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables, often with calculations.

```javascript
var num = 10;
num += 5;   // Equivalent to: num = num + 5;
num -= 3;   // Equivalent to: num = num - 3;
num *= 2;   // Equivalent to: num = num * 2;
num /= 4;   // Equivalent to: num = num / 4;
num %= 2;   // Equivalent to: num = num % 2;
```

- **Comparison Operators:**
Comparison operators are used to compare values and return boolean results.

```javascript
var a = 10;
var b = 5;

var isEqual = a == b; // Equal to
var isNotEqual = a != b; // Not equal to
var isGreater = a > b; // Greater than
var isLess = a < b; // Less than
var isGreaterOrEqual = a >= b; // Greater than or equal to
var isLessOrEqual = a <= b; // Less than or equal to
```

- **Logical Operators:**
Logical operators are used to combine or manipulate boolean values.

```javascript
var isSunny = true;
var isWarm = false;

var isBoth = isSunny && isWarm; // Logical AND
var isEither = isSunny || isWarm; // Logical OR
var isNot = !isSunny; // Logical NOT
```
