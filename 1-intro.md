## 1. Introduction to JavaScript

- **What is JavaScript?**
JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web content. It allows developers to add behaviors and functionality to websites, enhancing user experience. Unlike HTML and CSS, which focus on structure and presentation, respectively, JavaScript is used for programming logic and interactivity.

- **Where can you use JavaScript?**
JavaScript can be used in various environments:
- **Web Browsers:** JavaScript is commonly used to enhance web pages by adding interactivity, animations, and dynamic content.
- **Server-side Development:** With technologies like Node.js, JavaScript can be used for server-side programming, allowing developers to build web servers and APIs.
- **Mobile App Development:** Frameworks like React Native enable building mobile applications using JavaScript.
- **Desktop Applications:** Tools like Electron enable creating cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies and JavaScript.
- **IoT (Internet of Things):** JavaScript can be utilized in IoT devices and applications.

- **Basic Example: Hello, World!**
Here's a simple example to display "Hello, World!" using JavaScript:

```javascript
// The following line outputs "Hello, World!" to the browser console
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

In a browser's developer console, you'll see the output "Hello, World!" displayed.

- **JavaScript in HTML:**
You can include JavaScript code directly within an HTML document using the `<script>` tag. It can be placed in the `<head>` or `<body>` section of the HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
<script>
    // JavaScript code goes here
    console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
</script>
</head>
<body>
<!-- HTML content -->
</body>
</html>
```

Placing JavaScript at the end of the `<body>` tag is a common practice to ensure that the JavaScript code doesn't block the rendering of the page content.
